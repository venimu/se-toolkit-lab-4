## When editing code (`backend/`, `frontend/`)

Read and follow:

- [`docs/design/architecture.md`](docs/design/architecture.md) — C4 architecture, domain model, container layout, component structure, and design decisions
- [`docs/contributing/conventions/code.md`](docs/contributing/conventions/code.md) — naming, comments, type safety, linting, shift-left testing, security

## Other files

Do NOT apply task/wiki conventions to files under `instructors/` (internal design notes).

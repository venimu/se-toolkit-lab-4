# Study tech roles involved in the chosen product

**Time:** ~30-40 min

**Purpose:** Understand the different tech roles involved in developing and maintaining a software product and their responsibilities.

**Context:** Now that you have analyzed the product architecture, you need to understand what roles are typically involved in building and maintaining such systems.

## 0. Follow the `Git workflow`

Follow the [`Git workflow`](../git-workflow.md) to complete this task.

## 1. Create an issue

Title: `[Task] Roles and skills mapping`

## 2. Create `docs/roles-and-skills.md`

Create the file and add the following sections:

### `# Roles and skills`

The document title.

### `## Components and roles`

For each selected component from `architecture.md`, list IT roles that are likely involved in the development and maintenance of that component.

Use a nested list. Example:

```markdown
- Mobile app
  - Mobile engineer (iOS/Android)
  - QA
  - ...
- Payment service
  - Back-end engineer
  - DevOps
  - QA
- ...
```

### `## Roles and responsibilities`

1. Select any five roles from the previous section.
2. Consult an LLM or a search engine to find out what are the typical responsibilities of these roles (what do people holding these roles do?).
3. For each selected role, briefly describe the responsibilities.

### `## Common skills across roles`

Based on your intuition and some research, list technical skills that are required for these responsibilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Issue created
- [ ] `docs/roles-and-skills.md` created
- [ ] Components mapped to roles (at least 5 components)
- [ ] Role mapping seems reasonable for this product
- [ ] 5 roles described with responsibilities
- [ ] Common skills are listed
- [ ] Partner reviewed and approved
- [ ] PR merged

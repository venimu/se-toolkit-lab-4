# Plan skill development

**Time:** ~40-60 min

**Purpose:** Create a structured plan to develop a technical skill that will enhance your capabilities in software engineering.

**Context:** Building on the skills assessment from [Task 3](../required/task-3.md), you will now create a detailed plan to develop one key skill with specific goals, resources, and tracking methods.

## Steps

Note: follow the [`Git workflow`](../required/procedure.md) to complete this task.

### 1. Create an issue

Title: `[Task] Plan skill development`

### 2. Choose a skill

Choose one skill that you decided to improve this semester in the required [Task 3](../required/task-3.md).

### 3. Create `docs/skill-development-plan.md`

Create the file and add the following sections:

#### `## About the skill` (3–5 sentences)

- Explain what this skill is.
- Describe why it's important for your development as a software engineer.

#### `## Goals`

Formulate 2 [SMART](https://helpfulprofessor.com/smart-goals-examples-for-students/) goals related to this skill for this semester.

#### `## Planning` (5–10 sentences)

- Provide a plan to achieve the goals.
